			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">My Intrest in Information Technology!</h2>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">Information Technology is an area of business that greatly interests me as it explores and provides many ways of simplifying and developing technology to act in a more effective way. Furthermore, my interest in Information Technology came about during COVID, where I began learning Java online. As I continued to learn Java, I joined discord groups and forums which helped me learn and develop my understanding of Java. </p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">I chose to change to a Bachelor of IT at RMIT university because of my previous positive experience at the university studying a Bachelor of Business (Human Resources Management). Further, I decided to study IT with RMIT as it is on the forefront of innovation and education in the IT field, additionally their extensive industry connections attracted me to RMIT.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">Throughout my studies I am keen to engage in the innovative and exciting IT knowledge and skills my course will equip me with. Building upon this, I hope to pursue a career in the cyber security industry and know that the Bachelor of IT at RMIT will be an excellent avenue into this field, providing me with the foundations to excel in my dream career. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Ideal Job / Position</h3>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">The position of cyber security specialist advertised above is a job I would be interested in pursuing after my studies. This role involves having an extensive knowledge, skills and understanding to prevent, manage and defuse potential cyber security threats. This position is particularly interesting to me as it combines my interest in cyber security with hands on and engaging work. The skills I currently have include the IT knowledge and skills I am developing in my course at RMIT, as  well as the further skills I have developed through my use of Java, providing me with a strong foundation to my ideal job. To be successful in securing a role like this I will need to earn my bachelor’s degree in IT and potentially postgraduate study to specialise in the cyber security field. Further, to be successful candidate I would need to have some experience or insight into the field, such as gaining an internship during my studies. I plan to complete an internship during my undergraduate studies related to cyber security as well as seeking employment in a relevant field. Also, I am researching postgraduate studies options to further my skills and knowledge.

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">My Profile / Personality</h3>
		<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">As shown by the Myers Briggs Test, my personality type is an ESTP-T. ESTP-T are individuals whose strengths involve being rational and practical, perceptive and sociable. In regard to working within a group these attributes will assist in taking change and being able to discuss, develop and guide effective progress to be made. Moreover, the Online Learning Style test deemed that I am a visual learner. This will support my group as I will be able to visualise what our group will need to-do in order to effectively manage and finish our assignment. Lastly, the big 5 personality test has indicated that my top 3 attributes are openness, extraversion and agreeableness. As explored by Corinna E. Löckenhoff<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168724/">¹</a>, the strong attributes of openness, extraversion and agreeableness suit the role of an individual in management as they are able to effective communicate, visualise and predict what must be done within a given timeframe. With this in mind, I suggest I find individual's who are openminded and are open to discussion and differing opinions to allow for different views and perspectives to be explored.

			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
